#MyPod

## A Podcast Player and Blogging App

## Summary

This is my back-end capstone from my last six months at NSS. A Podcast player designed for users to listen and discuss their favorite podcasts. Listen to new episodes and blog about what you've heard. I've spent the last two years doing exactly that and filling notebooks with ideas, reminders, and all sorts of interesting thought experiments. Just another way to utilize this incredible media platform. Also to be able to revisit past thoughts and ideas. Utilizing ASP.NET(C#), AngularJS and Bootstrap. -Currently still in production.

##Stretch Goals

I look forward to adding a lot more features to this project as well as more intuitive UI/UX overall.
